# Future Sessions

I thought it might be nice to keep a running list of our future session ideas here too? It would be nice to be able to add or suggest things between sessions too.

@Bo I think you started a list on your phone as we were leaving last night? 

One below to get started.

## Package management?

Would people be interested in doing something on package management + conflicts? Bo you briefly mentioned using pacman last night. I'm curious if someone has looked into this in detail.

I'd like something that manages priorities + conflicts. But also provides a function to load version of each package that was used when I wrote a script. So that if I come back to something 3 years later I can return the environment to the same one that was used to write the script.
